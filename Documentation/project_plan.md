- **Training Resources:** User manuals and training materials will be created specifically for the Streamlit application. Interactive training sessions or demonstrations may also be conducted to familiarize end-users with the application.

## Post-Project Support

### 1. Application Maintenance and Support

- **Question:** How will post-project support for the Streamlit application be provided?

- **Support Description:** Post-project, support for the Streamlit application will be available to address any technical issues, questions, or updates. A designated point of contact will be established for end-users to reach out for assistance.

- **Support Channels:** End-users can reach out for support through email, a dedicated helpdesk, or scheduled support sessions.

### 2. Model Maintenance and Updates

- **Question:** How will model maintenance and updates be managed after the project is completed?

- **Support Description:** Regular model performance evaluations will be conducted, and updates may be required to maintain accuracy. Model maintenance and updates will be managed by the project lead to ensure continued reliability.

- **Communication:** Any updates or changes to the model that may affect predictions will be communicated to the HR department to maintain transparency.

## Documentation for Training and Support

- **Question:** How will training materials and support documentation be created and maintained?

- **Documentation Approach:** Training materials, user manuals, and support documentation will be created, documented, and stored for easy access by team members and end-users. These materials will be updated as needed to reflect any changes or improvements.

Effective training and support are essential to ensure that team members and end-users can maximize the benefits of the project. By providing comprehensive training and post-project support, we aim to enhance the user experience and maintain the project's long-term success.

# Conclusion

In conclusion, this project plan outlines the key aspects of our "Employee Departure Forecast" project, detailing the milestones, responsibilities, and timelines that will guide our project's execution. Here's a summary of the key points:

## Project Overview

Our project aims to develop a machine learning-based solution to predict employee departures. This predictive model will assist the HR department in identifying employees who may consider leaving their jobs, enabling proactive measures to retain valuable talent.

## Project Scope

We will consider essential employee attributes such as satisfaction level, monthly working hours, department, and more to train the predictive model. The project will culminate in the development of a user-friendly Streamlit application for HR department use.

## Project Objectives

Our primary objective is to create an accurate predictive model that can help HR in identifying potential employee departures. Secondary objectives include providing user training, post-project support, and maintaining model accuracy over time.

## Key Milestones

- Data Collection and Preprocessing
- Model Development and Training
- Streamlit Application Development
- User Training and Documentation
- Post-Project Support and Model Maintenance

## Responsibilities

- Prashant Nawale (Team Leader): Overall project management, data preprocessing, model development, Streamlit application development, documentation, stakeholder engagement.
- Academic Advisor: Project plan approval, change management approval, quality assurance sign-off, stakeholder engagement approval, project closure approval.

## Timelines

Project commencement is contingent on data availability, with a planned data collection phase. Subsequent phases will include data preprocessing, model development, and Streamlit application development. User training and support will be ongoing throughout the project.

## Training and Support

Team members will receive training in data preprocessing, analysis, and machine learning model development. End-users (HR department) will be provided with user-friendly training materials for the Streamlit application. Post-project support will be available for both technical issues and model maintenance.

## Dependencies

We have identified key dependencies related to data availability, software installation, stakeholder engagement, and timeline factors. Mitigation plans are in place to address potential delays.

## Risk Management

We have acknowledged potential risks related to data quality, model performance, and timeline delays. Mitigation strategies are in place to proactively address these risks.

## Communication Plan

A clear communication plan is established, including regular project status reports and stakeholder engagement strategies.

## Quality Assurance

Quality control and assurance processes are in place to ensure project deliverables meet established standards.

## Stakeholder Engagement

Stakeholder engagement strategies, including feedback mechanisms, have been defined to maintain strong collaboration with the HR department.

## Project Documentation

Various project documents, including the project plan, change management plan, quality assurance plan, and stakeholder engagement plan, will be created and maintained throughout the project.

## Project Deliverables

Deliverables include the machine learning model, Streamlit application, project reports, user manuals, and training materials.

## Conclusion

This project plan serves as our roadmap to successfully develop the "Employee Departure Forecast" solution. We are committed to leveraging machine learning techniques to assist the HR department in talent retention. Regular updates, documentation, and communication will ensure the project's success.

As we embark on this project journey, we look forward to its successful completion and the positive impact it will have on our organization.
